# Research: Asteroid Belt, Jovian System, Saturnian System, and Deep Interplanetary Transit

Date of research: 2026-10-06. Brief followed: `_BRIEF.md`. No figure is from memory; each table row cites a page opened this session.

## 1. Scope

The main Asteroid Belt (mass, spacing, classes, rotation, gravity, light, temperature, delta-v, light delay, radiation); the Jovian system (radiation belts, Galilean moons, magnetosphere, tides, irradiance, transfer, orbit regimes); the Saturnian system (rings, Titan, Enceladus, radiation, transfer); deep transit (cosmic-ray and solar-particle dose, propulsion, thermal rejection, transfer energy); power scaling and nuclear options; a short interstellar-precursor note.

## 2. SEARCH LOG

(Appended as work proceeds. Format: date, query or URL, rating, notes.)

All entries dated 2026-10-06. "WebFetch" returns a small-model summary of the page, not the raw page; where a number matters it is cross-checked or the raw text was read via a local download (marked "raw").

## 3. FINDINGS

**How to read the tables.** Each source is given a key in the Source key below (publisher, title, URL, date, class). A row's *Source* cell names the key and the place in it. "WebFetch summary" means the page text was summarized by the fetch tool and I did not see the raw page; "raw" means I read the text myself (PDF converted locally, or a page fetched with curl). Where a number matters and I only had a summary, the Confidence cell says so. All dates are access dates 2026-10-06 unless the source date is stated.

### 3A. Asteroid Belt

| Quantity | Value and units | Source | Primary or secondary | Cross-check | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Total mass of the main belt | 2.39e21 kg (about 4.0e-4 Earth masses, plus or minus 20 percent); other estimates 2.1e21 (Dawn-based, SwRI), 2.3e21 (NSSDCA), 2.7e21 (DeMeo and Carry total), 3.0e21 (Kuchynka and Folkner, cited by S12) | S9 sec. 3.3.2; S10; S5; S12 sec. 8 | Primary (preprint compiling ephemeris fits); primary-institutional; primary | Four independent statements, all within 2.1 to 3.0e21 | High for "2 to 3 e21 kg"; medium for the third digit (see Conflicts) |
| Belt mass relative to the Moon | About 3 percent (derived 3.25 percent from 2.39e21 over 7.346e22 kg); S10 says 3 to 4 percent | S9 (Moon mass in its table) and S10 | Primary | S10 | High |
| Extent of the belt | 2.06 to 3.27 AU (edges at the 4:1 and 2:1 resonances with Jupiter); most main-belt asteroids lie between 2.2 and 2.9 AU | S9 sec. 3.3; S5; S52 (Kirkwood gaps) | Primary; secondary | S5 and S9 agree | High |
| Mass concentration | Ceres 939.3e18 kg (Dawn) is 39 percent; Ceres, Vesta (259.076e18 kg), Pallas, Hygiea together 1.49e21 kg or 62 percent of 2.39e21 | S9 sec. 3.3.1 | Primary | S12: Ceres, Vesta, Pallas, Hygiea are about 31, 9, 7, 3 percent of 3.0e21 | High |
| Number of asteroids | 0.7 to 1.9 million with diameter of 1 km or more; about 10,000 above 10 km; hundreds of millions down to dust sizes | S10 | Primary-institutional | S11: 1.1 to 1.9 million (secondary); S52: over 200 above 100 km, 0.7 to 1.7 million above 1 km (secondary) | Medium (range is wide; debiased survey paper not opened) |
| Size-frequency slope | Theoretical strengthless collisional slope -3.5; preliminary observed slope for smaller objects -2.5; a change of slope between 15 and 25 km | Masiero et al. 2011 preprint (arXiv:1109.4096, raw; log row 97) | Primary (preprint, labeled preliminary) | None found | Low (preliminary, not debiased) |
| Volume of space the belt occupies | A few e25 km3 (S10); 2e26 km3 (S11); my derivation from a 2.1 to 3.2 AU annulus 1 AU thick gives 6.1e25 km3 | S10; S11; section 5.1 | Primary-institutional; secondary; derived | Derivation agrees with S10 | Medium |
| Spacing of objects: published statements | S10: average distance between asteroids larger than 1 km is "a few e5 km". S11 (and S52): "about 965,600 km". Probe collision odds "under 1 in a billion"; about 15 missions have flown through or past the belt and Lucy never has to maneuver | S10; S11; S52 | Mixed | Derived spacing for 1 km objects is 3 to 4.6 million km (section 5.1); the published figures do not reproduce from the published counts and volumes | Medium for the qualitative picture (a vast near-empty volume); low for the specific spacing numbers (see Conflicts) |
| Published reality versus popular depiction | S10 states the real belt "is far less densely packed than those often shown in the movies", and that a ship would "probably be alright" | S10 | Primary-institutional | S11 same statement | High |

With Ceres, Pallas, Vesta, Hygiea removed (45 percent of mass remains): C 14.4, P 11.0, S 8.4, B 3.6, M 3.3 | S12 Table 5 | Primary | S13 states primitive (C, P) material is more than half by mass excluding the top four | High for ranking; medium for decimals (the paper says it does not claim that precision) |
| Zonal distribution by mass | Inner belt: V 69, S 21, C 6 percent. Middle belt: C 70, B 15, S 8, P 4. Outer belt: C 52, P 15, B 13, M 10, S 5. All types occur in every region | S12 Table 6; S13 | Primary | S13 text agrees | High |
| Water in carbonaceous material | CI chondrites about 20 wt percent water, CM about 9 wt percent (cited values); C-complex asteroid surfaces average 4.5 wt percent (volume-weighted, Ceres excluded), range 0 to 11.5, uncertainty 4 wt percent at 90 percent confidence; Ceres up to 25 percent water per NASA | S14 (abstract and intro); S15 (abstract, sec. 5); S17 | Primary; primary (preprint); primary (outreach) | S14 and S15 differ by design (meteorite versus asteroid surface); S15 attributes the gap to space weathering | Medium (meteorite values are cited, not measured here; asteroid values carry a 4 wt percent error) |
| Metal in M-type bodies | Psyche is 30 to 60 percent metal by volume; density 4.172 plus or minus 0.145 g/cm3; dimensions 278 by 238 by 171 km; rotation 4.196 h; M-types are 3.3 percent of belt mass by S12 | S16; S8 (Farnocchia 2024, Shepard 2021); S12 Table 5 | Primary | S8 and S16 agree on a mix of rock and metal | Medium (single large body; M-class assignment is degenerate per S12) |
| Density of a stony body | Eros (S-type): 2.67 g/cm3 with porosity 10 to 30 percent | S8 (Yeomans et al. 2000) | Primary | None | High |
| Rotation periods | Most small bodies have periods between 2.2 and 20 h; about 1,600 of 32,249 bodies with accurate periods (as of 2022) are below 2.2 h. Large bodies larger than 0.15 km show a "spin barrier" near 2.2 h; critical period about 2.1 h at 2.5 g/cm3 (Pravec and Harris; scales as 1 over the square root of density) | S18 (both papers, raw) | Primary (preprints) | Two independent preprints agree | High |
| Rotation of named bodies | Ceres 9.074 h, Vesta 5.342 h, Pallas 7.813 h, Hygiea 13.828 h, Psyche 4.196 h, Eros 5.27 h, Ida 4.634 h, Mathilde 417.7 h | S8 | Primary | None | High |

| Surface gravity and escape speed | See section 5.2: Ceres 0.284 m/s2 (2.9 percent of standard gravity) and 516 m/s; Vesta 0.253 m/s2 and 364 m/s; Psyche 0.130 m/s2 and 170 m/s; a 1 km rubble body at 2,000 kg/m3 about 2.8e-4 m/s2 and 0.5 m/s | derived from S8 and S50 | Derived | None needed (direct formula) | High for GM-based values |
| Solar irradiance at belt distances | 321 W/m2 at 2.06 AU, 218 at 2.5 AU, 127 at 3.27 AU (23.6, 16.0, 9.4 percent of the Earth value 1361.0 W/m2); derivation section 5.3 | derived from S6, S7 | Derived (inverse square) | Method reproduces S6 Mars 586.2 and S1 Jupiter 50.26 W/m2 | High |
| Temperature at belt distances | Equilibrium of a rapidly rotating black sphere: 194 K at 2.06 AU, 176 K at 2.5 AU, 154 K at 3.27 AU. Published range for dust particles: 200 K at 2.2 AU down to 165 K at 3.2 AU (secondary) | derived from S6 and S50; S52 | Derived; secondary | Same order; dust figure is warmer than a black sphere, which is expected for small grains that emit poorly | Medium (real surface temperatures depend on albedo, rotation, regolith; not measured here) |
| Delta-v and transfer time, belt | Earth heliocentric orbit to belt (Hohmann, circular coplanar): 8.75 km/s total at 2.06 AU, 11.18 km/s at Ceres' distance, 12.28 km/s at 3.27 AU; time 0.95 to 1.56 years. Lecture table: 11.7 km/s and 1.4 years. From Mars orbit: 3.36 to 7.39 km/s, 1.2 to 1.9 years | S19 table; derived (section 5.4) | Secondary (course slides); derived from S7 | Derived values bracket the lecture value (lecture matches about 2.9 AU) | High for method; medium for the specific number because it depends on which belt radius is meant |
| Communication delay to the belt | One way 8.8 min (nearest, 1.06 AU) to 35.5 min (farthest, 4.27 AU) on a circular-coplanar approximation; light time over 1 AU is 499.0 s | derived from S7 (AU, c) | Derived | S6 and S1 give Earth distances for Mars and Jupiter that reproduce the same method | High |
| Radiation at belt distances | No direct belt dose measurement was found. Galactic cosmic rays dominate and vary only slowly with distance (published inner-heliosphere radial gradient about 3 percent per AU for protons, from Pioneer 10 abstracts); solar particle peak intensity falls as heliocentric distance to the power -3.7 to -2 (data between 0.05 and 1.01 AU only) | S52 (search summaries and ESA nugget); S41 | Secondary summaries; primary brief for the dose rate used in section 5.7 | Two independent statements on SEP scaling; GCR gradient from two abstracts | Low to medium (extrapolation beyond the measured distance range) |

JUICE: 50 krad at the outside of each equipment unit; array degradation over 25 percent in 4 years; mission external dose about 200 Mrad (S27). Europa Clipper: 150 krad(Si) design value, parts rated 300 krad, over 2 Mrad total ionizing dose expected over the mission (search summary of Andersen et al. 2020; paper not opened).

| Which orbits are survivable | Missions have avoided the core: Clipper stays beyond about 9 radii and JUICE mostly beyond 15 radii; Juno uses a polar orbit that crosses the belts quickly and dives below them near the planet; Galileo's equatorial passes inside Europa's orbit were the high-dose ones | S23 Table 1 and sec. 1.3; S25 | Primary | S20 says JUICE's trajectory "will remain outside of Jupiter's inner radiation belts" | High |
| Surface dose, Europa | About 5.4 Sv per day (about 540 rem per day) at the surface, "lethal within hours" (ESA wording); energy flux of ions and electrons above about 10 keV 5e10 to 8e10 keV per cm2 per second (about 0.08 to 0.13 W/m2, derived), uncertain by plus or minus 50 percent | secondary summaries of S28 and ESA (https://www.esa.int/.../Jupiter_s_radiation_belts_and_how_to_survive_them, 2023-04-06); S24 Table 20.1 | Secondary (5.4 Sv per day); primary (energy flux) | S24 states the dose rate at Europa's surface is about 10^2 to 10^3 times the solar-wind dose rate at the lunar surface (a ratio, not an absolute dose); ESA says lethal within hours | Low for the Sv per day figure (primary papers were behind a paywall); medium for energy flux |
| Surface dose, other moons | Energy flux above about 10 keV: Io 1e9, Ganymede 2e8 (equator) and 5e9 (polar caps), Callisto 2e8 keV per cm2 per second. Callisto surface about 0.01 rem per day (0.1 mSv per day). Europa fluxes more than 20 times those at Ganymede (JUICE) | S24 Table 20.1; secondary summaries (Callisto dose); S20 sec. 5.1.3 | Primary (flux); secondary (Callisto dose) | S24 flux ratio Europa to Callisto is 250 to 400; ESA says Callisto sees lower radiation than Ganymede and Europa; see Conflicts for why dose and energy flux ratios differ | Medium (flux), low (Callisto dose) |
| Galactic cosmic ray dose at Europa | Peak GCR dose about 6.3e-10 Gy per second at about 0.92 m depth, about 0.02 Gy per year; magnetospheric particles dominate the top meter except at high latitudes; Jupiter's field blocks the part of the GCR spectrum below a 14 GV cutoff | S29 (summary) | Primary (via summary) | S29 abstract (via search) says the same qualitative result | Low (summary only) |

| Europa ice and ocean | Ice shell 15 to 25 km thick, ocean 60 to 150 km deep, about twice the water of Earth's ocean; Juno microwave radiometer: shell averages about 29 km in the region of the 2022 flyby, about 5 km thinner if the ice contains dissolved salt | S30 | Primary (outreach) | The two numbers differ by definition (region and method) | Medium |
| Ganymede and Callisto interiors | Ganymede: ocean about 100 km thick under about 150 km of mostly ice; the only moon with its own magnetic field. Callisto: possible ocean about 250 km down, evidence "less compelling"; surface about 4 billion years old; tidal heating not significant | S31 | Primary (outreach) | ESA and NASA pages agree on Callisto | Medium |
| Io tidal and volcanic activity | Tidal surface bulge about 100 m; "hundreds of volcanoes", 50 to 100 erupting at once; about 1 ton of Io's gas ionized per second; heat flow 1 to 3 W/m2, about 100 TW total (news summaries of Park et al. 2024; derived check in section 5.9) | S32; S31 (Io facts) ; search summary of Park et al. | Secondary (news); primary (NASA Io page) | Derived 2.4 W/m2 from 100 TW and Io's radius agrees | Medium |

| Irradiance at Saturn | Derived 14.85 W/m2 at the mean distance (1.09 percent of Earth's 1361.0 W/m2), 16.5 at perihelion, 13.4 at aphelion. NASA text (search summary): the Sun is "nearly 90 times fainter" than at Earth, which is 1 over 91.7 from the derivation | derived from S6, S2; S51 | Derived; secondary | Method reproduces Mars and Jupiter published irradiance | High |
| Distance from Earth and light delay | 1,205.5e6 to 1,658.6e6 km; one-way 67.0 to 92.2 minutes (derived), round trip 134 to 184 minutes | S2; derived | Primary; derived | JUICE Jupiter round trip of about 90 minutes is consistent with the same method | High |
| Rings: mass | (1.54 plus or minus 0.49)e19 kg, which is 0.41 plus or minus 0.13 of the mass of Mimas; implied age 10 million to 100 million years. Derived: 0.64 percent of the asteroid belt's mass | S34 (raw) | Primary | S35 (earlier estimates "one to several Mimas masses") | High for order of magnitude, medium for the central value (the error is 32 percent) |
| Rings: thickness, composition | "About 10 m (30 ft) thick or so"; almost completely water ice; particle sizes from smaller than a grain of sand to mountain size; moonlets about 1 km; coldest recorded A-ring temperature -230 C. Mostly pure water ice with little contamination (S35) | S36; S35 | Primary (outreach); primary (chapter) | Two sources agree on water ice; no percentage found (the 95 percent figure I searched for did not appear in any source and is not used) | Medium |
| Titan bulk and orbit | Mass 1,345.5e20 kg, radius 2,575 km, density 1,880 kg/m3, gravity about 1.35 m/s2, escape about 2.64 km/s, orbit 1,221.87e3 km (20.27 Saturn radii), period 15.945 d, eccentricity 0.0292 | S4 (gravity and escape are "calculated values" in S4) | Primary | S37 Table 1: mass 13.457e22 kg, radius 2,575.0 km, gravity 1.35 m/s2 | High |
| Titan atmosphere and surface | Surface pressure about 1.5e5 Pa (1.5 bar); surface temperature 94 K; 95 percent nitrogen, under 5 percent methane, 0.1 percent hydrogen; scale heights 15 to 50 km; winds under 1 m/s at the surface rising to about 40 m/s near 60 km; surface sculpted by liquids and wind: dunes at low latitudes, hydrocarbon lakes and seas at high latitudes, river networks; surface conditions near the triple point of methane; water-ice bedrock | S37 (both, raw); NASA chapter 6 (title only) | Primary | Two independent reviews agree | High |
| Titan atmospheric shielding | Derived column mass about 11,100 g/cm2, 10.8 times Earth's 1,030 g/cm2. Qualitative: the thick atmosphere stops trapped magnetospheric particles; the dominant energetic radiation at the surface is a reduced flux of galactic cosmic rays; GCR protons and alpha particles ionize mainly near 65 km altitude (search summaries of Gronoff et al.) | derived from S37; secondary summaries | Derived; secondary | None for the dose itself | Medium for the column mass; low for dose (no number found) |
| Enceladus bulk and orbit | Mass 1.08e20 kg; radii 257 by 251 by 248 km; density 1,610 kg/m3; orbit 238.02e3 km (3.95 Saturn radii); period 1.370 d; escape about 0.24 km/s as listed in S4 (reproduced by my derivation). S4's summary also gave a surface gravity of about 0.027 m/s2, which does NOT follow from its own mass and radii: derived gravity is about 0.11 m/s2 (section 5.2), so the 0.027 figure is rejected (see Conflicts) | S4 | Primary | Gravity re-derived from mass and mean radius in section 5.2 gives 0.11 m/s2, not 0.027 | High |
| Enceladus plumes and water | Water vapor injection about 200 kg/s (UV occultations); more than 90 percent of the plume is water vapor; gas jets with Mach 5 to 8 and speeds above 1,000 m/s; internal power of the south polar terrain about 15.8 GW; a global ocean about 45 km deep under an ice shell about 20 km thick (under 5 km at the south pole); molecular hydrogen in the plume indicating hydrothermal reactions; Enceladus feeds the E ring | S38 (15.8 GW fetched; others from search summaries) | Primary (JPL 15.8 GW); secondary (the rest) | None for the 200 kg/s and ocean numbers | Medium for 15.8 GW; low for the rest |
| Saturn radiation environment, compared with Jupiter | Qualitative and published: Saturn's ion belt (over 10 MeV) spans from near the planet to Tethys (4.9 radii) and is segmented by moons and rings; the electron belt lies outside the A ring (beyond 2.27 radii), peaks near 2.5 radii, and MeV electrons are measurable only to about 7 radii; at Jupiter significant intensities reach several tens of MeV; Saturn's belts have "much lower particle fluxes" because moons and rings absorb particles and the magnetic and rotation axes are aligned. No dose-rate comparison in common units was found | S22 sec. 3 and 5 | Primary (preprint) | S23 states Saturn's belts are limited in extent while Jupiter's fill the magnetosphere | Medium (qualitative, no numbers) |
| Transfer from Earth | Hohmann: 6.0 years and 15.7 km/s (course table); derived 6.08 years and 15.74 km/s (departure excess 10.30, arrival excess 5.44). Cassini: about 6.7 years by Venus-Venus-Earth-Jupiter gravity assists; Saturn orbit insertion 626 m/s over 96 minutes | S19; derived; S39 | Secondary; derived; primary | Derived and lecture agree to 0.1 km/s | High |

### 3F. Interstellar-precursor constraints (brief, published concept studies only)

| Quantity | Value and units | Source | Primary or secondary | Cross-check | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Current-technology interstellar speed | Voyager 1, launched 1977, left the Solar System after 37 years at 17 km/s, less than 0.006 percent of light speed; at current propulsion the nearest stars take "100 millennia" | S49 abstract (raw) | Primary (preprint) | 17 km/s over c is 5.7e-5, matching "under 0.006 percent" | High |
| Kinetic energy law | KE equals rest mass times (gamma minus 1) times c squared; at 0.3 c the kinetic energy is about 1 megaton of TNT per kg; derived 1.04 Mt per kg using the 4.184e15 J per megaton convention, which I did not source | S49 sec. 2.8 (raw) | Primary | Derived 1.037 Mt per kg | High |
| Directed-energy concept | A 50 to 70 GW array ("DE-STAR 4") pushing a gram-scale wafer with a 1 m sail to about 26 percent of light speed in about 10 minutes, reaching Alpha Centauri in about 20 years; the same driver for 100 kg gives about 1 percent of light speed | S49 abstract and sec. 1 (raw) | Primary (concept) | None | Low as a design basis; the energy figure is from the paper |
| Fusion-pulse starship concept | Project Daedalus (British Interplanetary Society, 1973 to 1978): 12 percent of light speed, 50 years to a star 5.9 light years away, 54,000 t total, 50,000 t propellant, 250 pellets per second, first-stage exhaust about 10,600 km/s | S52 (Wikipedia; original report not opened) | Secondary | S46's 125 AU case gives a smaller interstellar-precursor point of 244 km/s in 10 years | Low (secondary only) |

## 4. CONFLICTS

Each item shows both values and the likeliest reason. None is resolved by picking a winner unless stated.

1. **Belt total mass.** 2.1e21 kg (Dawn-based, S10), 2.3e21 (S5), 2.39e21 (S9, from the ephemeris fit of Pitjeva and Pitjev 2018), 2.7e21 (S12, sum of its classes including the outer zones), 3.0e21 (Kuchynka and Folkner, cited in S12). Likely reasons: different epochs and ephemeris fits; whether Hungaria, Cybele, Hilda and Trojan objects are counted; Ceres' measured mass entering the fit only after Dawn. Use "about 2 to 3 e21 kg".
2. **Ceres' share of the belt.** 39 percent (derived from Dawn's 939.3e18 kg over S9's 2.39e21), 31 to 35 percent (S12, larger total), 25 percent (S17, an older NASA outreach statement). Likely reason: S17 predates the Dawn mass and uses an older total mass. Use 39 percent with the stated total.
3. **Belt mass relative to the Moon.** "About 3 percent" (S52), "3 to 4 percent" (S10), derived 3.25 percent (S9). Likely reason: rounding and the 2.1 to 2.7e21 range in item 1.
4. **Spacing between asteroids.** S10: "a few e5 km" for objects over 1 km. S11 and S52: "about 965,600 km" (600,000 miles). My derivation from S10's own counts (0.7 to 1.9 million) and volume (a few e25 km3): 3 to 4.6 million km if uniformly spread. The 3e5 km spacing would need about 2e9 objects and the 965,600 km figure about 7e7 to 2e8 objects in the stated volumes. I cannot tell which definition each source used (nearest neighbor, mean spacing, a smaller size threshold). The qualitative result agrees in every source: the belt is almost entirely empty space.
5. **Belt volume.** A few e25 km3 (S10) versus 2e26 km3 (S11). My derivation for a 2.1 to 3.2 AU annulus 1 AU thick gives 6.1e25 km3, supporting S10. S11 probably assumes a thicker belt.
6. **M-type share.** 3.3 percent of belt mass (S12) versus "about 10 percent of the belt" in popular summaries (secondary). Likely reasons: mass versus number, and the M class is degenerate with other X-types (S12 says so).
7. **Psyche's density.** 4.172 plus or minus 0.145 g/cm3 (S8, 2024 mass), 3,400 to 4,100 kg/m3 (NASA outreach as summarized in search), 3.9 g/cm3 (older, secondary). Likely reason: successive mass and volume determinations. Use S8.
8. **Saturn's mean distance in AU.** The summary of S2 printed 9.537 AU, but 1,432.041e6 km divided by 149.5979e6 km is 9.573 AU. I used the km figure. Probably a transcription error in the summary; the raw page was not seen.
9. **Enceladus' surface gravity.** The summary of S4 printed about 0.027 m/s2 with escape speed 0.24 km/s. Those two are inconsistent (escape speed squared over twice the radius gives 0.11 m/s2) and the mass and radii give 0.1135 m/s2. I rejected the 0.027 and used the derived value.
10. **Europa's surface dose units.** One secondary summary gave "2.3 Mrad or 540 rem per day". 540 rem is 5.4 Sv, which is about 540 rad for electron and gamma radiation; 2.3 Mrad is about 4,000 times larger. The two cannot both be per day at the same depth. 2.3 Mrad is more likely an accumulated or depth-specific figure from the lander study. I used only "about 5.4 Sv per day", flagged low confidence, and did not use 2.3 Mrad per day.
11. **Dose ratio between Europa and Callisto.** 5.4 Sv per day over 0.1 mSv per day is a ratio of 54,000; the Galileo energy-flux ratio in S24 is 250 to 400 and a secondary source says "300 times". Likely reason: the energy flux is dominated by keV to MeV particles that stop in the first millimeters, while the human dose is set by penetrating MeV electrons and their X-rays, which fall off faster with distance from Jupiter. Both statements can be true; do not mix them.
12. **Share of JUICE's lifetime dose from Europa.** "About a third" from two Europa flybys (ESA page) versus "about 25 percent" (a search summary of an ESA document). I did not open the underlying document for the 25 percent.
13. **Juno vault mass.** "Almost 400 pounds (172 kg)" (S25) versus "about 200 kg" including more than 20 electronics assemblies (a trade article seen only in a search summary). Likely definition: empty vault versus loaded vault.
14. **Hohmann delta-v to the belt.** 11.7 km/s and 1.4 years (S19) versus 8.75 to 12.28 km/s and 0.95 to 1.56 years (derived for 2.06 to 3.27 AU). The slide's value corresponds to about 2.9 AU; it does not say which radius it used.
15. **Direct Fusion Drive thrust.** S46 Table 19 lists 4 to 5 N at 1 MW with jet power 0.46 MW and 8,000 to 8,500 s. Thrust from jet power is 2 times power over exhaust speed, which gives 11.0 to 11.7 N. At 10 MW the same formula gives 95 to 115 N against 35 to 55 N listed. A factor of 2 to 3 within the report; the report's mission table uses an exhaust speed of 80 km/s. I used the table values as "what the study claims" and did not correct them.
16. **Radiator areal mass in S46.** 4.2 kg/m2 in the nominal parameter table and 2.1 kg/m2 in a figure label. Unreconciled.
17. **Irradiance at Jupiter in words.** "25 times less" (S26, rounded), "27 times lower" (S21), derived 1 over 27.1 from 1361.0 and 50.26. No real conflict; rounding.

## 5. DERIVED FIGURES

Constants (all from S50 and S7 unless stated): c = 299,792.458 km/s; 1 AU = 149,597,870.7 km; Sun GM = 1.32712440041e11 km3/s2; G = 6.67430e-11 m3/kg/s2; sigma = 5.670374419e-8 W/m2/K4; standard gravity 9.80665 m/s2; 1 eV = 1.602176634e-19 J; Earth GM 398,600.4355 km3/s2; Jupiter system GM 126,712,764.1; Saturn system GM 37,940,584.84. Orbits are treated as circular and coplanar with the fact-sheet semi-major axes. Computations were run in Python in the scratchpad; the inputs are the figures cited above.

### 5.1 Belt volume and object spacing (uniform-spread idealization)

- Volume V = pi (b squared minus a squared) t, with a = 2.1 AU, b = 3.2 AU, t = 1 AU (S10's stated extent): pi times (10.24 minus 4.41) = 18.3 AU3, times 3.348e24 km3 per AU3 = 6.13e25 km3. For 2.06 to 3.27 AU and t = 1 AU: 6.78e25 km3; for t = 0.5 AU: 3.39e25.
- Mean spacing d = (V over N) to the one third. For V = 6.13e25 km3: N = 7e5 gives 4.4e6 km; N = 1e6 gives 3.9e6 km; N = 1.9e6 gives 3.2e6 km; N = 1e4 (objects over 10 km) gives 1.8e7 km. For t = 0.5 AU and N = 1e6 the spacing is 3.2e6 km.
- Objects needed for a given spacing in 6.13e25 km3: 3e5 km needs 2.3e9; 965,600 km needs 6.8e7 (2.2e8 using S11's 2e26 km3).
- Caveat: real asteroids are concentrated toward the ecliptic and the mid-belt, so local densities can be several times the mean; the order of magnitude (millions of km between objects of 1 km or more) is not changed by that. Small objects below 1 km are far more numerous and not counted here.

### 5.2 Surface gravity and escape speed

Formulas: g = GM over R squared; escape speed = square root of (2 GM over R); R = half the mean diameter in S8; equatorial centrifugal acceleration = (2 pi over P) squared times R. Spherical approximation (Eros and Ida are very elongated, so local values vary by several times).

| Body | R (km) | g (m/s2) | Percent of standard gravity | Escape speed (m/s) | Centrifugal at equator over g |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ceres | 469.7 | 0.2839 | 2.9 | 516 | 0.06 |
| Vesta | 261.4 | 0.2530 | 2.6 | 364 | 0.11 |
| Pallas | 256.5 | 0.2072 | 2.1 | 326 | 0.06 |
| Hygiea (GM poor) | 203.6 | 0.169 | 1.7 | 262 | 0.02 |
| Psyche | 111.0 | 0.1299 | 1.3 | 170 | 0.15 |
| Eros (mean) | 8.42 | 0.0063 | 0.06 | 10.3 | 0.15 |
| Ida | 16.0 | 0.0107 | 0.11 | 18.5 | 0.21 |
| Mathilde | 26.4 | 0.0099 | 0.10 | 22.9 | about 0 |
| Generic 1 km rubble body, 2,000 kg/m3 | 0.5 | 2.8e-4 | 0.003 | 0.53 | n/a |
| Generic 10 km body | 5 | 2.8e-3 | 0.03 | 5.3 | n/a |
| Generic 100 km body | 50 | 2.8e-2 | 0.29 | 52.9 | n/a |
| Enceladus (mass 1.08e20 kg, mean R 252 km) | 252 | 0.1135 | 1.2 | 239 | n/a |
| Titan (S4 mass, R 2,575 km) | 2,575 | 1.354 | 13.8 | 2,641 | n/a |
| Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto (S3 mass and diameter) | 1,821; 1,561; 2,631; 2,411 | 1.796; 1.315; 1.429; 1.236 | 18.3; 13.4; 14.6; 12.6 | 2,558; 2,026; 2,742; 2,441 | n/a |

Spin-limit check: critical period 3.3 h over the square root of density in g/cm3 gives 2.24 h for Ceres (density 2.162, actual 9.07 h) and 2.02 h for Eros. Small bodies spinning near the barrier have surface speeds close to their escape speed (Eros circular speed at the surface 7.3 m/s).

### 5.3 Irradiance, equilibrium temperature and collector area

Irradiance S = 1361.0 W/m2 over d squared (d in AU). Equilibrium temperature for a rapidly rotating gray sphere with albedo 0 and emissivity 1: T = (S over 4 sigma) to the one fourth. Subsolar black plate facing the Sun: T = (S over sigma) to the one fourth. Collector area per kilowatt = 1,000 W over (S times efficiency) with efficiency 0.17 (the end-to-end figure Juno achieved: 14 kW over 60 m2 at 1 AU is 17.1 percent, 500 W over 60 m2 at 50.26 W/m2 is 16.6 percent; because Juno's area is "more than 60 m2" these are upper bounds).

| Location | d (AU) | S (W/m2) | Fraction of Earth | T sphere (K) | T subsolar (K) | m2 per kW at 17 percent |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mars | 1.524 | 586.1 | 0.431 | 225.5 | 318.9 | 10.0 |
| Belt inner edge | 2.06 | 320.7 | 0.236 | 193.9 | 274.2 | 18.3 |
| Belt middle | 2.50 | 217.8 | 0.160 | 176.0 | 248.9 | 27.0 |
| Ceres' distance | 2.76 | 178.6 | 0.131 | 167.5 | 236.9 | 32.9 |
| Belt outer edge | 3.27 | 127.3 | 0.0935 | 153.9 | 217.7 | 46.2 |
| Jupiter (mean) | 5.204 | 50.26 | 0.0369 | 122.0 | 172.5 | 117 |
| Saturn (mean) | 9.573 | 14.85 | 0.0109 | 90.0 | 127.2 | 396 |

Perihelion and aphelion irradiance: Mars 713 and 490 W/m2; Jupiter 55.5 and 45.7; Saturn 16.5 and 13.4. Checks: derived Mars 586.15 (published 586.2) and Jupiter 50.26 (published 50.26); L over 4 pi AU squared gives 1361.17 W/m2 against 1361.0. An albedo A lowers sphere temperature by the factor (1 minus A) to the one fourth; for Ceres (A = 0.09, S8) that is 2.3 percent.

### 5.4 Heliocentric Hohmann transfers (circular, coplanar)

Vis-viva: departure excess = |v_perihelion of transfer minus v_circular(origin)|; arrival excess = |v_circular(destination) minus v_aphelion of transfer|; time = pi times the square root of (a_t cubed over GM_Sun), a_t = (r1 + r2) over 2. "Sum" is the total heliocentric speed change, excluding departure from or capture into a planetary orbit.

| From Earth (r = 149.598e6 km) to | Departure excess (km/s) | Arrival excess (km/s) | Sum (km/s) | Time (d) | Time (years) | Delta-v from a 300 km Earth orbit (km/s) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Mars | 2.945 | 2.649 | 5.594 | 258.9 | 0.71 | 3.59 |
| Belt 2.06 AU | 4.776 | 3.975 | 8.751 | 345.6 | 0.95 | 4.20 |
| Belt 2.5 AU | 5.815 | 4.598 | 10.412 | 422.8 | 1.16 | 4.65 |
| Ceres' distance | 6.321 | 4.861 | 11.182 | 472.6 | 1.29 | 4.90 |
| Belt 3.27 AU | 7.076 | 5.198 | 12.275 | 569.7 | 1.56 | 5.29 |
| Jupiter | 8.793 | 5.643 | 14.437 | 997.7 | 2.73 | 6.30 |
| Saturn | 10.296 | 5.440 | 15.735 | 2,219.7 | 6.08 | 7.29 |

The last column assumes departure from a circular orbit of radius 6,371 + 300 km: delta-v = sqrt(v_inf squared + 2 GM/r) minus sqrt(GM/r), where the 300 km altitude is my assumption (circular speed there is 7.73 km/s). S19's table (5.56, 11.7, 14.4, 15.7 km/s; 0.71, 1.4, 2.7, 6.0 years for Mars, belt, Jupiter, Saturn) matches to 0.1 km/s except the belt (see Conflicts).

| From Mars orbit (r = 227.956e6 km) to | Departure excess (km/s) | Arrival excess (km/s) | Sum (km/s) | Time (years) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Belt 2.06 AU | 1.742 | 1.615 | 3.357 | 1.20 |
| Belt 2.5 AU | 2.768 | 2.444 | 5.212 | 1.43 |
| Ceres' distance | 3.279 | 2.819 | 6.098 | 1.57 |
| Belt 3.27 AU | 4.054 | 3.338 | 7.392 | 1.86 |
| Jupiter | 5.882 | 4.269 | 10.151 | 3.08 |
| Saturn | 7.565 | 4.582 | 12.147 | 6.53 |

Jupiter orbit to Saturn orbit: 1.805 plus 1.547 = 3.353 km/s, 10.04 years.

Capture into a circular orbit with periapsis at a given radius (one burn): delta-v = sqrt(v_inf squared + 2 GM/r) minus sqrt(GM/r). With the Earth-Jupiter arrival excess of 5.643 km/s: radius of Io's orbit 7.82 km/s (circular speed 17.33 km/s), Europa's 6.50, Ganymede's 5.51, Callisto's 4.70 (circular speed 8.20, period 16.7 days), 10 Jupiter radii 6.34, 1.5 Jupiter radii 14.57 (circular speed 34.4 km/s, period 5.4 h). Saturn with arrival excess 5.440 km/s: Enceladus' orbit radius 6.04 km/s, Titan's 4.00 km/s (circular speed 5.57 km/s), 10 Saturn radii 4.54 km/s. For comparison JUICE's actual capture into a long resonant orbit cost about 900 m/s and Cassini's 626 m/s; one-burn capture into a circular orbit is the expensive extreme.

### 5.5 Light delay

Light time over 1 AU = 149,597,870.7 km over 299,792.458 km/s = 499.00 s. One way to Mars 3.0 to 22.3 minutes (54.6e6 to 401.4e6 km, S6). Belt 8.8 minutes (1.06 AU) to 35.5 minutes (4.27 AU). Jupiter 32.7 to 53.8 minutes (588.5e6 to 968.5e6 km, S1); round trip 65 to 108 minutes. Saturn 67.0 to 92.2 minutes (1,205.5e6 to 1,658.6e6 km, S2); round trip 134 to 184 minutes. A target at 125 AU: 17.3 hours one way.

### 5.6 Orbits and tides in the giant planet systems

- Moon orbit radii in planet radii: Io 5.90, Europa 9.39, Ganymede 14.97, Callisto 26.34 Jupiter radii (71,492 km); Enceladus 3.95, Titan 20.27 Saturn radii (60,268 km). Orbital speeds (circular, from GM): Io 17.33, Europa 13.74, Ganymede 10.88, Callisto 8.20 km/s; periods 42.5 h, 85.2 h, 171.6 h, 400.6 h; circular speed at 1.1 Jupiter radii 40.1 km/s.
- Synchronous orbit radius (period equals rotation period) from the fact-sheet rotation periods: Jupiter 160,020 km = 2.24 radii (inside the synchrotron belt layer of 1.1 to 3 radii, S20); Saturn 112,248 km = 1.86 radii.
- Tidal acceleration difference across a rigid structure of length L at orbital radius r around a planet of GM: about 2 GM L over r cubed. For Jupiter at Io's orbit: 3.4e-7 m/s2 per 100 m, 3.4e-6 per km, 3.4e-5 per 10 km; at Europa 8.4e-8 per 100 m; at Ganymede 2.1e-8; at Callisto 3.8e-9. Compare Io's own surface gravity 1.80 m/s2: tides matter for very long structures and for the moons' interiors, not for ordinary structures.

### 5.7 Galactic cosmic ray dose accrual during transit

At 1.8 mSv per day (S40, inside MSL's hull, taken as constant) against the 600 mSv career limit (S41, reached after 333 days): Earth to Mars Hohmann (258.9 days) 0.47 Sv or 78 percent of the limit; Earth to belt 345.6 to 569.7 days 0.62 to 1.03 Sv (104 to 171 percent); Earth to Ceres' distance 472.6 days 0.85 Sv; Earth to Jupiter 997.7 days 1.80 Sv (3.0 times the limit); Earth to Saturn 2,219.7 days 4.0 Sv (6.7 times). A linear 3 percent per AU gradient would add about 3 to 7 percent at the belt, 13 percent at Jupiter and 26 percent at Saturn at the destination (S52 gradient, extrapolated; ignores solar-cycle variation and the shielding used). With the lower 0.5 mSv per day figure (S41, surface-mission environment) the limit is reached after 1,200 days. These are dose-rate scalings of one measured rate, not a radiation-transport result.

### 5.8 Propulsion relations

Exhaust speed v_e = Isp times 9.80665 m/s2; jet power = F v_e over 2, so thrust per megawatt of jet power = 2 MW over v_e.

| Option | Isp (s) | v_e (km/s) | v_e squared over 2 (MJ per kg of exhaust) | Thrust per MW jet power (N) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Chemical LH2 and LOX | 452.3 | 4.44 | 9.8 | 451 |
| Nuclear thermal (NERVA class) | 850 | 8.34 | 34.7 | 240 |
| NSTAR maximum | 3,100 | 30.4 | 462 | 66 |
| NEXT maximum | 4,220 | 41.4 | 856 | 48 |
| VX-200 | 5,000 | 49.0 | 1,202 | 40.8 |
| Direct Fusion Drive 1 MW class | 8,000 | 78.5 | 3,077 | 25.5 |
| Direct Fusion Drive 10 MW class | 12,000 | 117.7 | 6,924 | 17.0 |

Checks: VX-200 jet power 5.7 N times 49.03 km/s over 2 = 139.7 kW, which is 69.9 percent of 200 kW (reported 72 percent). NSTAR at 92 mN and 3,100 s: 1.40 kW jet power, 60.8 percent of 2.3 kW; at 19 mN and 1,900 s it is 35.4 percent of 0.5 kW. DFD: see Conflicts item 15.

### 5.9 Io heat flux check

100 TW (secondary news figure) over the surface area 4 pi R squared with R = 1,821.3 km (S37 Table 1, Io) = 100e12 W over 4.169e13 m2 = 2.40 W/m2, inside the quoted 1 to 3 W/m2 range. Io's radius is also consistent with S3's 3,643 km diameter.

### 5.10 Solar sail force

Radiation pressure = S over c = 1361.0 over 299,792,458 = 4.540e-6 N/m2 absorbing, 9.080e-6 N/m2 for an ideal reflector at normal incidence. Ideal-reflector pressure and the area needed for 1 N: 1 AU 9.08 micropascals and 110,137 m2; 2.5 AU 1.45 and 688,355 m2; 5.2 AU 0.335 and 2.98e6 m2; 9.57 AU 0.099 and 1.01e7 m2. An 86 m2 sail at 1 AU gives at most 0.78 mN, 0.029 mN at Jupiter's distance.

### 5.11 Radiator sizing

Per side, emissivity eps, temperature T: q = eps sigma T to the fourth. 300 K, eps 0.85: 390 W/m2; 300 K, 0.95: 436; 400 K, 0.85: 1,234; 400 K, 0.95: 1,379; 500 K, 0.9: 3,190; 800 K, 0.9: 20,900. One-sided area per megawatt rejected: 2,561 m2 at 300 K (0.85), 810 m2 at 400 K (0.85), 314 m2 at 500 K (0.9), 48 m2 at 800 K (0.9), assuming a sink at 0 K (deep space; sunlight or a warm planet raises the load). Published case S45: 126,400 W over 133.4 m2 = 947 W/m2 of quoted area, against 1,160 W/m2 per side from eps 0.84 at 395 K (the difference includes the view to a warm lunar surface and the 45-degree sun case). Specific mass of S45's 40 kWe system: 10,046 kg over 40 kWe = 251 kg per kWe (3.98 W per kg), versus S46's 1,345 kg for a 1 MW fusion core (0.74 kW of fusion power per kg; the report lists 0.75), and 2.4 W per kg for an MMRTG (110 W over 45 kg).

### 5.12 Rocket equation, impulsive

Mass ratio = exp(delta-v over v_e); propellant fraction = 1 minus 1 over mass ratio. From a 300 km Earth orbit, delta-v 3.59 km/s (to Mars transfer): chemical 55.5 percent, nuclear thermal 35.0, NSTAR 11.1, VX-200 7.1, DFD 4.5. Delta-v 11.0 km/s (Jupiter transfer plus capture at Callisto's orbit radius): chemical 91.6 percent (mass ratio 11.9), nuclear thermal 73.3 (3.74), NSTAR 30.4 (1.44), VX-200 20.1 (1.25), DFD at 8,000 s 13.1 (1.15). Delta-v 11.3 km/s (Saturn transfer plus capture at Titan's orbit radius): 92.2, 74.2, 31.0, 20.6, 13.4 percent. Low-thrust spiral escape and capture add to these delta-v values.

### 5.13 Other ratios

Titan atmospheric column: 1.5e5 Pa over 1.35 m/s2 = 1.11e5 kg/m2 = 11,100 g/cm2; Earth 1.01e5 Pa over 9.81 m/s2 = 1,030 g/cm2; ratio 10.8 (inputs from S37 Table 1). Saturn's rings over the belt: 1.54e19 over 2.39e21 = 0.64 percent; over Ceres 1.6 percent. Belt over Moon 2.39e21 over 7.346e22 = 3.25 percent; top four over total 1.49e21 over 2.39e21 = 62.3 percent. Europa energy flux in power units: 5e10 to 8e10 keV per cm2 per second times 1.602e-16 J per keV times 1e4 cm2 per m2 = 0.080 to 0.128 W/m2; Callisto 3.2e-4 W/m2; Io 1.6e-3; Ganymede 3.2e-4 (equator) and 8.0e-3 (poles).

## 6. CONSTRAINTS FOR ANY INHABITANT

Whoever builds or occupies a works, outpost or orbital installation in these regions meets the following. Each item cites the finding it rests on (section 3 table, or section 5 derivation). Where a human-shaped machine is affected, the constraint is stated in general terms: a machine body has mass, waste heat, electric charge and joints, and obeys the same physics.

**Asteroid Belt**

- The belt is a very large, nearly empty volume. Objects of 1 km or more are millions of kilometers apart (3A spacing rows, 5.1) and probes pass through without maneuvering (3A, S10). The difficulty of the belt is distance, transfer time and delta-v, not collisions with other bodies.
- Transfer cost sets supply: 0.95 to 1.56 years and 8.8 to 12.3 km/s heliocentric from Earth's orbit, plus 4.2 to 5.3 km/s to leave a 300 km Earth orbit; from Mars' orbit 1.2 to 1.9 years and 3.4 to 7.4 km/s (3A delta-v row, 5.4). Every kilogram arrives with propellant penalties that grow with the exhaust speed gap (5.12).
- Light delay of 9 to 36 minutes one way (3A, 5.5) rules out real-time remote operation from Earth or Mars; local work needs autonomy or accepted lag.
- Light is 24 percent (2.06 AU) to 9 percent (3.27 AU) of Earth's (3A, 5.3): about 18 to 46 m2 of collector per kilowatt at the 17 percent end-to-end efficiency real arrays have reached (3E). Equilibrium temperatures of a body are about 154 to 194 K; a warm machine or habitat must be insulated against a cold background and must shed its waste heat only by radiation (5.11).
- Surface gravity is tiny: 0.28 m/s2 on Ceres, 0.13 on Psyche, about 0.006 to 0.01 on bodies of 10 to 50 km, about 3e-4 on a 1 km body (5.2). Escape speeds range from 0.5 m/s (1 km) through 10 m/s (Eros) to 516 m/s (Ceres). Anything moved faster than the escape speed leaves for good: a joint-driven body can push itself off the surface, cannot fly by flapping, and needs anchoring and traction aids because its weight is almost nothing. Tools, spoil and thruster plumes are lost to space on small bodies.
- Rapidly rotating small bodies are near the spin barrier (rotation periods mostly 2.2 to 20 hours; critical period near 2.1 h at 2.5 g/cm3, 3A rotation rows); centrifugal acceleration reaches 15 to 21 percent of gravity at the equator of small bodies (5.2), and rubble-pile structure is expected for bodies above about 0.15 km. Surface thermal cycling follows the same few-hour rotation periods (Ceres 9.07 h, Vesta 5.34 h, Psyche 4.20 h).
- Resources are not uniform: C-type material is about half the mass of the population (52.5 percent) while S-types are 8.4 percent and M-types 3.3 percent (3A composition row). Hydrated carbonaceous meteorites hold about 9 to 20 wt percent water, but the surfaces of C-complex asteroids average about 4.5 wt percent with a 0 to 11.5 range (3A water row), and the water is bound in minerals that release it at several hundred degrees Celsius (dehydroxylation between 400 and 770 C, S14). Metal-rich bodies exist (Psyche 30 to 60 percent metal by volume) but are a few percent of the belt's mass.
- Galactic cosmic rays dominate the radiation at belt distances (3A radiation row). Hull thickness barely reduces their dose (3D, S40); transit time sets the dose (5.7): the 600 mSv career limit is reached after about 333 days at the measured cruise rate.

**Jupiter and the Galilean moons**

- The inner magnetosphere is the most severe radiation environment in the Solar System (S20). The belts' core lies inside Io's orbit (5.9 Jupiter radii); Galileo took 30 to 40 krad per crossing behind about 0.8 cm of aluminum equivalent (3B). Any installation between the planet and Europa's orbit (9.4 radii) must be built for tens to hundreds of megarad external dose; electronics are the limiting item (design values 50 krad per box for JUICE, 150 krad design and 300 krad parts for Clipper), typically met with centimeter-scale metal vaults (Juno: 1 cm titanium, factor about 800, 172 kg; Lander study: about 8.5 mm aluminum, about 72 kg) (3B).
- Surface dose differs sharply by moon: energy flux at Europa 5e10 to 8e10 keV per cm2 per s (0.08 to 0.13 W/m2) versus 2e8 at Callisto and at Ganymede's equator and 5e9 at Ganymede's polar caps; unshielded exposure at Europa is described as lethal to humans within hours (3B). Callisto (26.3 radii) is the published candidate for a low-dose base; its surface dose is quoted at about 0.01 rem per day (low confidence) (3B).
- Arrays degrade in the belts: more than 25 percent loss over 4 years for JUICE's array (3B, 3E). Power at Jupiter is 3.7 percent of Earth's (50.26 W/m2): about 117 m2 per kilowatt at 17 percent, or about 120 m2 per kilowatt as flown by Juno. Large loads need nuclear power; the published surface-fission concept is about 251 kg per kWe (3E, 5.11).
- Light delay of 33 to 54 minutes one way (5.5) means supervised autonomy, not remote control, for any works.
- Transfers cost 2.7 years and 14.4 km/s heliocentric from Earth's orbit (about 3.1 years and 10.2 km/s from Mars' orbit); arriving at 5.6 km/s relative to Jupiter means 4.7 km/s of capture to a circular orbit at Callisto's radius in one burn, 5.5 km/s at Ganymede's, 6.5 at Europa's and 7.8 at Io's (5.4). Gravity assists and long elliptical captures cut this (JUICE: about 900 m/s, total mission 2.6 km/s) at the price of time.
- Jupiter's well is deep: escape speed from Callisto's orbit radius is 11.6 km/s, from Io's 24.5 km/s (3B bulk and 5.4); the moons' own escape speeds are 2.0 to 2.7 km/s (3B).
- Near Io, a dense cold sulfur and oxygen plasma (above 3,000 per cm3 at 5.6 to 6 radii) and about 1 ton per second of ionized gas fill the region out to Europa's orbit (3B). Surface charging and plasma interaction were not quantified in my sources.
- Tidal forces over structure scales are negligible (3.4e-7 m/s2 across 100 m at Io's orbit, 5.6); tides matter for the moons' heating (Io 1 to 3 W/m2; Europa and Ganymede interior oceans).
- Moon gravity is 12 to 18 percent of standard (1.24 to 1.80 m/s2), and surface temperatures are about 90 to 160 K (3B).

**Saturn, its rings and moons**

- Sunlight is about 1.1 percent of Earth's (14.85 W/m2): about 396 m2 per kilowatt at 17 percent, so power must be nuclear for any substantial load (Cassini flew three radioisotope generators; 3C, 3E).
- Light delay of 67 to 92 minutes one way (134 to 184 round trip) (5.5). Transfers: 6.1 years and 15.7 km/s from Earth's orbit (Cassini: about 6.7 years with gravity assists), 4.0 km/s to capture to a circular orbit at Titan's radius, 10.0 years and 3.35 km/s from Jupiter's orbit (3C, 5.4).
- Saturn's radiation belts are bounded by rings and moons and are described as much weaker than Jupiter's, with MeV electrons measurable only to about 7 radii and an ion belt that ends at Tethys' orbit (4.9 radii) (3C radiation row); no common-unit dose comparison was found, so margin should be assumed generous until measured.
- The rings are about 1.54e19 kg of mostly water ice in a layer about 10 m thick, particle sizes from sand to mountain; Enceladus vents about 200 kg/s of water (low confidence) with escape speed 0.24 km/s and gravity 0.11 m/s2 (3C, 5.2). Water ice is available in orbit without a gravity well; the cold (ring temperatures down to -230 C) and the fine, high-surface-area particles are the working conditions.
- Titan has a 1.5 bar nitrogen atmosphere at 94 K with 10.8 times Earth's overhead mass (3C, 5.13). That atmosphere stops trapped particles, leaving cosmic rays as the main source at the surface; surface liquids are hydrocarbons; surface winds are under 1 m/s. Materials and machines must work at 94 K in a dense cold gas; heat retention, not heat rejection, becomes the thermal problem (no number found).

**Deep transit**

- Cruise dose is about 1.8 mSv per day inside a spacecraft hull, shielding-insensitive for cosmic rays; a flat rate reaches the 600 mSv limit in 333 days and totals 1.8 Sv to Jupiter and 4.0 Sv to Saturn on a Hohmann trip (3D, 5.7). A solar particle storm shelter needs 10 cm (centennial event) to 20 cm (millennial event) of water-equivalent on top of a 20 g/cm2 aluminum vehicle (3D).
- Thrust and exhaust speed trade against power: 1 N at 80 km/s exhaust needs 40 kW of jet power; 1 kN at that exhaust speed needs 39 MW (5.8, derived). At the published fission surface-power mass (about 4 W/kg) a 1 MW electrical plant would be about 250 t (5.11). Chemical rockets need a 92 percent propellant fraction for the Jupiter or Saturn transfers from low Earth orbit; a nuclear thermal rocket at 850 s needs about 73 to 74 percent (3D, 5.12).
- Waste heat must be radiated: 390 to 436 W/m2 per side at 300 K, 1,234 to 1,379 W/m2 at 400 K (5.11). The published 40 kWe fission concept needs 126 kW of waste heat rejected and 134 m2 of radiator (3D). Any large power source is also a large radiator.

**Later-era interstellar flight (brief)**

- The energy cost of relativistic travel is set by the kinetic energy formula: about 1 megaton of TNT per kilogram at 0.3 c (3F). Current propulsion at 17 km/s takes on the order of 100,000 years to the nearest stars (3F). Light delay grows to 17 hours at 125 AU (5.5).

## 7. CANDIDATE HANDWAVES

Each item would require physics to be bent, or a technology not yet demonstrated. Flagged, not accepted. The developer decides.

1. **Fusion propulsion for fast interplanetary transit** (Mars in 110 days, Jupiter in 1.2 years, S46). The study itself calls D-3He fusion undemonstrated (present experiment about 0.1 T versus about 5 T needed) and puts a flight unit around 2040 "with sufficient support". It assumes 55 keV electron temperatures, 95 percent synchrotron wall reflection, a specific power of 0.75 to 1.25 kW per kg and radiator mass of 2 to 4 kg/m2 (3D). Treat any fusion-driven fast transit as a handwave unless the developer chooses to accept it.
2. **A specific power far above present fission systems.** The published 40 kWe fission concept is about 4 W/kg (251 kg per kWe) while the fusion concept claims about 750 to 1,250 W/kg; the gap is two to three orders of magnitude (3D, 5.11). Any large electrical or propulsion plant lighter than that is a handwave.
3. **High thrust and high exhaust speed at once** (for example hundreds of N at 80 km/s or more): needs tens of MW of jet power and the radiators to match (5.8, 5.11). The largest demonstrated electric thruster in these sources produced 5.7 N at 200 kW (3D).
4. **Crewed transits to Jupiter or Saturn within the dose limit without large shielding mass.** At the measured cruise rate a 2.7-year trip delivers about 1.8 Sv and a 6.1-year trip 4.0 Sv (5.7); no source here shows a way to cut galactic cosmic ray dose with moderate shielding (3D). Assuming it away is a handwave. (Machine bodies are less dose-limited than people, but parts ratings of 50 to 300 krad and single-event effects are not addressed in my sources.)
5. **Habitats or works inside Europa's orbit without very heavy shielding or deliberate belt-avoiding orbits.** The published practice is to stay outside about 9 radii, or to cross quickly (3B). Long residence inside Io's orbit would be a handwave.
6. **Real-time communication across 33 to 92 minutes of light delay.** Needs a faster-than-light link; there is none (5.5).
7. **A dense, obstacle-filled belt that requires piloting through "fields" of rocks.** The published reality is millions of km between objects of 1 km or more (3A, 5.1). A dense belt would contradict the measured mass and counts.
8. **Solar power for large loads at Saturn.** Not a violation of physics, but about 396 m2 per kilowatt (5.3); if the developer wants "light" infrastructure there, nuclear power is the published route (3E).
9. **Ocean, ring and moon water used without any energy or thermal budget.** Extraction from hydrated minerals needs heating to hundreds of degrees (3A, S14); ice mining needs power; not a handwave by itself but easy to under-count.
10. **Interstellar travel at fractions of light speed with reaction mass or with onboard fuel.** The published concepts either use enormous external beam power (50 to 70 GW for a gram-scale craft, S49) or a 54,000 t fusion-pulse starship (S52, secondary). Anything faster, cheaper or with crews is a handwave.
11. **Robot body.** Only the gel brain is waved by the brief. The body still has to reject its heat by radiation in vacuum (about 400 W/m2 per side at 300 K), carry electronics inside a dose budget, and obey escape-speed limits on small bodies (5.2, 5.11).

## 9. REJECTED SOURCES

- **Wikipedia (Asteroid belt, Project Daedalus):** used only for leads and clearly marked secondary where a figure appears; no number from it is used as a sole basis except the Daedalus parameters and the belt dust temperature range, both labeled low confidence.
- **Fandom wikis, forum posts and slideshare copies** (nasa.fandom.com Callisto, terraforming.fandom, newmars forum, nasaspaceflight forum, slideshare "Project HOPE"): not used, not authoritative. The Callisto 0.01 rem per day figure appears in them and in search summaries, so it is carried only as a low-confidence secondary value.
- **Popular summaries giving "2.3 Mrad per day" for Europa and "200 or 100 krad per day behind 2.2 or 5.0 g/cm2 at the core of the belts" and "Galileo 3 to 4 times design dose":** the first is internally inconsistent with 540 rem per day (Conflicts 10); the second and third appeared only in search summaries I could not trace to a raw page, so they are not used.
- **Search summary figure for Saturn's ring "95 percent water ice":** did not appear in any opened source; not used.
- **Search summary figure of "9.537 AU" for Saturn and "0.027 m/s2" for Enceladus gravity:** tool summary errors, rejected against the km figures and the mass and radius (Conflicts 8 and 9).
- **Figures I put into queries from memory** (the million-object count in query 16, the Cassini RTG power in query 106, the Cuzzi percentage in query 72, the VX-200 numbers in query 91): not used unless the source returned them independently. The VX-200 numbers are confirmed in the raw paper; the others are not used or are labeled.
- **ResearchGate stubs, Wiley and Springer pages that returned walls or redirects:** nothing taken from them except search-summary leads.
- **Mirror copy of the NASA HOPE slides (eltamiz.com):** used because the NTRS download failed, with the mirror status stated in the source key; the NTRS record number is 20030063128.

# Eighth research tranche (harvesting Mercury and Venus whole; the benefits of mining Mercury, Venus and the Sun): the exact dispatch prompts

**Saved 2026-10-11 ~20:50.** Triggered by the developer's request after the planetary-disassembly scales were computed: *"split off some subagents to do research on all of the various aspects of harvesting Mercury and Venus [the planets themselves]. Additionally, split off some additional subagents to do full research on any and all benefits that can be gained from mining the two, plus 'mining' the Sun. Among other things, one thing I wonder about (for research by one subagent, aside from the others) is if it's possible to harvest Oxygen atoms from either Mercury or Venus, since it's plentiful to harvest Hydrogen atoms from the Sun, and truck those over to Mars to give Mars water."*
Each agent is told to read ONLY its own numbered section below plus the common rules, so the saved text and the dispatched text are the same.
**To re-dispatch a lost agent:** Agent tool, type general-purpose, model opus, background, with the one-line prompt: *"Your task is section N of /home/kuroskalacs/Documents/Doll-Fi/media/games/Inner Tepenia/InnerTepeniaGDD/Worldspace/Locations-and-Levels/Object_Oriented_Location_Synthesis/research/_dispatch_prompts_tranche8.md . Read the common rules at the top and section N only, and follow them exactly. Your file may already exist: open it first, read its SEARCH LOG, and continue from where it ends; do not restart and do not duplicate sections."*
(`SendMessage` resumes a live agent only.) Status check: `python3 -I research/_calc/tranche8_status.py`.

**Developer rulings that govern all eleven:** research the physics on its own terms; do NOT force results into any story, timeline or canon; the briefs contain none. Report plainly anything that cuts against a premise in the question, with its numbers. "Benefits" means real, physically grounded gains with their numbers and the conditions under which they hold; it does not mean advocacy.

## COMMON RULES (apply to every section)

You are a research agent for the OOLSD library. Your shared brief is at /home/kuroskalacs/Documents/Doll-Fi/media/games/Inner Tepenia/InnerTepeniaGDD/Worldspace/Locations-and-Levels/Object_Oriented_Location_Synthesis/research/_BRIEF.md . Read it first and follow it exactly (it is final; nothing in it changes), including the nine output sections, the search-log discipline, "no figure from memory", and the 120-word final reply.
- Research physics and engineering only. Assume no story, timeline or setting. If a concept is infeasible, uneconomic or only a thought experiment, say so plainly and give the numbers that decide it. Mark each finding DEMONSTRATED, ENGINEERING-STUDIED, or SPECULATIVE.
- **Create your file FIRST** (heading plus `## SEARCH LOG`) and append as you go, so an interruption leaves something usable. If your file already exists, open it, read its SEARCH LOG, and continue from where it ends.
- **Scratch folder:** put any temporary file ONLY in /tmp/claude-1000/-home-kuroskalacs-Documents-Doll-Fi-media-games-Inner-Tepenia-InnerTepeniaGDD/3ccdb441-c6c0-49c3-a71c-ab4a4fdd3c1e/scratchpad/ in a subfolder named after your own file. **Never delete, move or overwrite any file in the research folder other than your own output file.** Ten other agents are writing there at the same time.
- Where an arithmetic result matters, run it (Python is available; run with `python3 -I`) and show the formula and inputs; inputs must be sourced constants. Save any calculation script you want kept in your scratch subfolder; paste its key output into your Derived figures section.
- Work breadth-first across the checklist, then go back and query each quantity from a second angle (LAW 0-R). A quantity found once is one source. Primary sources are papers, agency reports, handbooks and datasets; popular pages are leads only.
- **Sibling files** (read-only, to avoid repeating): you may read the files named in your section, and always `starlifting_synthesis.md` and `inner_system_mining_synthesis.md` in the same folder, which summarize earlier tranches and say what is already known (cite them, do not re-derive). Do not read or edit anything else in the repository.
- Known facts you must not re-research but may build on: Mercury's surface has only about 1 to 2 wt% iron (the metal is in a core 420 to 470 km down); Venus's atmosphere is 4.8 x 10^20 kg, 96.5% CO2, with hydrogen only about 7 x 10^14 kg; the Sun's photosphere is 0.7438 hydrogen by mass and its escape energy is 1.91 x 10^11 J/kg; the solar wind carries about 1.3 x 10^9 kg/s; uniform-sphere binding energies are 1.79 x 10^30 J (Mercury) and 1.57 x 10^32 J (Venus).

TOPIC (the developer's specific question): can oxygen be harvested from Mercury or Venus, hydrogen be harvested from the Sun, and both be trucked to Mars to make water there? Cost out every part of the chain, and compare each link with its alternatives. Report plainly where the premise holds and where it does not (hydrogen from the Sun is plentiful in the Sun, but is it plentiful to harvest?).

Checklist (cover each, or list the gap under Open threads with the reason):
1. Oxygen on Mercury: oxygen mass fraction of the surface and of the whole planet (cite the Mercury files; add the mineral oxygen budget), extraction processes and their energy per kilogram at Mercury's solar flux (use and cite the processing file for molten regolith electrolysis, carbothermal, hydrogen reduction; add what changes with sulfur, sodium and low iron), the form of the product (gas or liquid oxygen), its storage and boil-off at Mercury's temperatures, and the launch to Mercury orbit.
2. Oxygen on Venus: oxygen in CO2 (mass fraction), extraction by solid-oxide electrolysis (cite the Venus file), the product streams (oxygen and carbon monoxide), what the carbon monoxide is worth, storage at cloud level, and the 9 km/s export problem (cite; add anything new, for example whether oxygen could be exported by a different route than a rocket).
3. The comparison that decides the question: oxygen availability at the destination and along the route. Oxygen is about half of rock by mass everywhere: report oxygen mass fractions of lunar regolith, carbonaceous and S-type asteroids, Phobos and Deimos, and Mars itself (soil, perchlorates, CO2 atmosphere, water ice), with extraction energies; then the delta-v and fleet cost of bringing oxygen to Mars from Mercury, Venus, the Moon, the belt and Mars's own surface. State what the sourced numbers say about importing oxygen to Mars at all.
4. Hydrogen from the Sun: three routes, each costed from sourced rates: (a) collecting the solar wind (collector area per tonne per year at 1, 0.3, 0.1 and 0.05 AU; cite the starlifting file's 3.09 x 10^-15 kg m^-2 s^-1 at 1 AU and the Genesis yield; add the composition: hydrogen versus helium fractions and what can be separated; what a magnetic or electrostatic scoop could capture; storage); (b) lifting hydrogen from the photosphere (energy per kilogram, cite 1.91 x 10^11 J/kg; the literature on beamed or magnetic lifting); (c) intercepting coronal mass ejections or other solar outflows. State the yield per unit of hardware for each.
5. Hydrogen from elsewhere, for comparison: Jupiter and Saturn (escape 59.5 and 35.5 km/s, the Palaszewski studies), the ice giants, comets and Kuiper-belt ice, Ceres and carbonaceous asteroids (water content), the Moon's and Mercury's polar ice, Phobos and Deimos, Mars's own ice (cite the Venus file's inventories), Venus clouds (cite). For each: inventory, distance, delta-v to Mars, extraction energy.
6. Moving hydrogen: the properties of liquid hydrogen (density, boiling point, boil-off in space from sourced data; zero-boil-off cryocooler masses), hydrogen carriers (ammonia, methane, hydrazine, hydrates, water itself, metal hydrides) with hydrogen mass fractions and handling, and whether it makes sense to send hydrogen rather than water (hydrogen is 11.19% of water by mass: compute what that does to the fleet size).
7. The chain as a whole: for stated water amounts to Mars (1 kt, 1 Mt, 1 Gt, and the mass of a global layer 1 m deep), compute the hydrogen and oxygen masses needed, the solar-wind collector area for the hydrogen, the oxygen plant output, the fleet sizes using the earlier files' tug and window figures (cite them), and the propellant and time. Compare with simply delivering water from the nearest ice (Mars's own, Phobos, Ceres, comets).
8. Chemistry and safety of combining hydrogen and oxygen at Mars into liquid water: energy released, reaction control, and the alternative of making water by reducing Mars's oxides with the hydrogen.

4. Surface stability: pressure and temperature conditions for liquid water at the surface, evaporation and freezing rates, the Martian surface pressure and the effect of delivered water on it; what greenhouse forcing would be needed (published terraforming studies, for example the CO2 inventory available for warming, Jakosky and Edwards and others; find the primaries).

Needs: the water required for (a) a settlement's life support and industry (kg per person per day, from the life-support files; cite), (b) agriculture, (c) rocket propellant, (d) a lake, sea or ocean of stated depth over stated area; compute the masses and compare with the present inventory and with the delivery rates other files give.
6. Radiation and magnetosphere: the effect of Mars's lack of a global field on atmospheric and water loss and on any delivered volatiles; the proposed magnetic shield at Mars-Sun L1 (published studies, their numbers).
7. Alternatives to delivering hydrogen and oxygen separately: delivering ice bodies, importing nitrogen and carbon as well (Mars lacks nitrogen: compute the N2 mass for a stated pressure), partial pressure requirements for plants and humans; the role of volatiles other than water.

Solar-wind matter: composition and flux (cite the starlifting file's figures; add isotopic and trace composition from Genesis and in-situ results): hydrogen, helium-4, helium-3, neon, argon, nitrogen, carbon, oxygen, metals; the yield per unit collector area at stated distances for each; which of these are worth collecting and what they would be used for (fusion fuel, propellant, lifting gas, water-making hydrogen, noble gases).
2. Helium-3 and fusion fuel: the solar wind's He-3 fraction, how it compares with lunar regolith (cite the Moon file) and gas-giant atmospheres (cite the starlifting and trucking files), and the state of D-He3 fusion (no net energy demonstrated; cite); what the physics says about the value of He-3 as fuel and the quantity needed for stated power levels.
3. Solar energy: direct sunlight as the dominant energy resource of the inner system: power available per square meter at stated distances; space solar power and swarm concepts; efficiency and mass per watt; the number of times human energy use equals the sunlight a stated collector area would intercept (derive from sourced numbers).
4. Radiation pressure and photon propulsion: solar sails, the "sundiver" Oberth maneuver, perihelion boosts, the acceleration and speed achievable (cite the network file; add literature on sails and solar-thermal propulsion near the Sun); solar-thermal rockets and solar-powered launch; the benefit for outbound missions and for trucking.
5. Gravity and the Oberth effect: using the Sun's well for velocity (solar Oberth burns), the requirement and the survivability (cite the starlifting file's Parker data); the delta-v advantage for escaping the Solar System and for cargo moving sunward.
6. The near-Sun environment as a process resource: very high solar flux at 0.1 to 0.3 AU for solar furnaces and vapor processing (cite the Mercury file's concentration limits; add published solar-furnace temperatures and the materials that survive), and the value for refining or sterilization.
7. Stellar-scale options from the literature: starlifting, stellar engines, and the mass-energy-return questions (cite the starlifting file; add only what is new); the value of solar mass loss rates; and the proposals to harvest antimatter or other exotic products from the Sun (report their evidence level and any rejection by peer review).
8. Costs and conditions: heat, shield mass, autonomy, communications, collector area; the minimum infrastructure (cite the starlifting file).
9. A ranked, sourced table of benefits by "who could use it" and "cost to get it", stating which benefits need no matter to be lifted from the Sun.

TOPIC: what a kilogram of each inner-system material is worth, to whom, and what transport cost it can bear: the break-even logic that decides which mining is worth doing. Physics and published cost analyses only; no invented prices.

Checklist (cover each, or list the gap under Open threads with the reason):
1. Reference prices and cost anchors: cost per kilogram to low Earth orbit and onward (cite the trucking file's anchors and add current primary data), the price of water and propellant in space as used in published economic analyses, and the cost of terrestrial equivalents (steel, aluminum, silicon, oxygen, nitrogen, platinum-group metals, helium) from primary data sources (USGS, World Bank, IEA or similar), with dates.
2. Published break-even analyses: Sonter, Hein et al., Metzger, and other techno-economic analyses of lunar, asteroid and propellant production: their assumed prices, markets and break-even points; the sensitivity of each result to the price assumptions and to launch cost (report disagreements).
3. Demand sinks inside space: tonnage of shielding, propellant, structural metal, life-support consumables and construction material that published habitat, power-satellite and settlement designs require (cite SP-413, SP-428, DRA 5.0 figures from the earlier files), converted into a demand curve by scale of enterprise.
4. Demand on Earth: which space-produced materials or services could earn a return on Earth (power, platinum-group metals, helium-3, data and computation), with the published transport cost and market-size limits; what a flood of material would do to terrestrial prices.
5. Transport cost per kilogram on each inner-system route (Moon, near-Earth asteroids, belt, Mercury, Venus, solar wind) using the earlier files' delta-v, tug, mass-driver and sail figures: derive the energy and propellant per kilogram delivered and, with stated cost inputs, the delivered cost range; show the arithmetic.
6. The break-even table: for each material and source, the transport cost it can bear against its value in each destination (Earth orbit, Mars orbit, Mars surface, Mercury region), stating which routes pass and which fail on the sourced numbers; state the uncertainty.
7. Value of time and capital: the delay costs of long routes (cargo in flight, capital tied up: Little's Law from the network file) with published discount rates for space ventures, and the effect on break-even.
8. Non-monetary value: where the benefit is capability or survival rather than price (for example propellant at Mars), stated as the capability enabled and its mass cost, not as a price.

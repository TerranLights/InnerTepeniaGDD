# Zhongshan: T8 round record for P08A_Composition (the roster's shape, the closing axis, Gate 4 and pooling), 2026-11-10

**What this is.** The record of the three-reader rounds behind `Amendment_Rederivation_P08A_Composition_2026-11-10.md` (the piece; 1159 lines, `sha256` `7aefdb339015a5c0`). It states what each tool returned and where each file is; it does not restate the piece. **Everything here is PROPOSED;** no pass file was edited. The run's log is `Amendment_Log_2026-11-10.md`.

**Isolation.** Fresh readers and a fresh merge writer, each with a clean brief and its own private staging folder; nothing from any other location's run is in any list, brief or record of this piece (log Z-01).

**Items re-derived:** `C1` (the roster's shoulder and tail), `C2` (rows too small to show), `C3` (whether any origin assumes a polar climate), `C4` (the closing axis and the weakest-finding gate), `U2` (which groups could pool); first-check verdicts in the note's section J. **Rests on:** `P02_Arrival` (merged before this piece's dispatch; `DR-107`).

## Round 0: the list and the briefs

The three readers' lists are identical (`cmp`). The list (17 entries), as dispatched:

Brief template `scratchpad/zs/tools/zs_t8_brief.md` (generator `zs_pieces.py`); the three briefs differ only in the title's reader letter, the reader letter, the staging folder, the output path and the number range (A 1 to 99, B 101 to 199, C 201 to 299). Brief `sha256`: A `fa2e59eed7c6e955`, B `7ac5e6ce630f21b8`, C `58f4d60d9f337d90`. Before dispatch each brief's cited lines were checked against its list (`zs_check_brief.py`; log Z-13 or later).

## Round 1: three independent readers

- Reader A: `.t8_xc_P08A_Composition_readerA.md` beside the pass (880 lines, `sha256` `00f42c179e0088af`).
- Reader B: `.t8_xc_P08A_Composition_readerB.md` beside the pass (868 lines, `sha256` `5e5a02bed0c686ac`).
- Reader C: `.t8_xc_P08A_Composition_readerC.md` beside the pass (872 lines, `sha256` `f487c29a38713ec8`).

## Round 2: the mechanical check

## Round 3: the cross-check (each reader continued by SendMessage, given the other two outputs)

The verdict lines, as `grep` returns them (each reply beside the pass as `.t8_xc_P08A_Composition_round3_reader<X>.md`):

```
reader A L31: **Verdict on reader B: CONSISTENT**
reader A L118: **Verdict on reader C: CONSISTENT**
reader B L48: **Verdict on reader A: CONSISTENT**
reader B L132: **Verdict on reader C: CONSISTENT**
reader C L38: **Verdict on reader A: CONSISTENT**
reader C L111: **Verdict on reader B: CONSISTENT**
```

## The merge

One merge writer (fresh; not a reader), brief `scratchpad/zs/pieces/P08A_Composition/M/brief.md` (template `zs_merge_brief.md`; `sha256` `2a3e8c544dcfc2bc`), merge rule `M-246` as `PRE-TRIP_INSPECTION_RECIPE_TRIAL.md` §N.2 states it. Its return, as given: `Amendment_Rederivation_P08A_Composition_2026-11-10.md — 1159 lines. This PROPOSED merge of readers A, B and C under M-246 agrees with the first check's NARROWS verdict on all five items (C1, C2, C3, C4, U2): it numbers 72 findings, 29 choices and 11 questions in one series, settles 23 contradictions between the readers in section 5, and passed a read-only check of all 179 quotations against their admitted source spans with none missing.`

## Merge checks (run on the piece before this record existed)

**1 · Normalized quotation pre-check** (`scratchpad/zs/tools/zs_postmerge.py`; corpus: the list's sources whole, the pass's numbered files and amendment notes, the reader outputs and Round 3 replies, the item outputs). Raw output, whole:

```
corpus files: 43; quoted strings (12+ chars, paired within a block): 226; not found: 7; blocks with an odd quote count (hand-check): 0
  NOT FOUND (block at L388): …because the practices that had to become universal were the ones addressing a condition no named party's source had a practice for, and, for the ice underfoot and a wind that blows all year, no row's source at all.
  NOT FOUND (block at L553): The leader sets the default and **cannot impose**, because the remainder outnumbers it by 1.79 to 1 (64.156 to 35.83).
  NOT FOUND (block at L553): and the Primary row alone outweighs the whole Significant tier (24.10), so not even the tier together approaches it.
  NOT FOUND (block at L700): Would support one non-negotiable institution; read separately, the three are Notable rows read at their tier (`R3`, `R7`).
  NOT FOUND (block at L803): by 1.79 to 1
  NOT FOUND (block at L916): about nine to five
  NOT FOUND (block at L958): about nine to five
```

**2 · Quotation audit** (`python3 Worldspace/Locations-and-Levels/Universal_Location_Methodology/Tools/quotation_audit.py "<pass folder>" --files <piece> --own-pass`, from the repo root; tool last committed 2026-11-02; no uncommitted edits). Raw output, excerpted (22 miss lines omitted, kept whole beside the pass as `.t8_xc_P08A_Composition_quotation_audit.txt`):

```

corpus files : 6898   chars: 109,002,757
files audited: Amendment_Rederivation_P08A_Composition_2026-11-10.md
own-pass mode: a quotation may also be found in this pass's OTHER files (never in its own file)

```

**2b · Triage of the audit's misses** (same script; the audit reads no dot-file). Raw output, whole:

```
audit NOT FOUND fragments: 22; (a) found in the corpus: 7; (b) the piece's own unquoted prose: 8; (c) for hand triage: 7
  (c) L77: (l139); twelve notable entries totaling 29.32 (l140-142); and
  (c) L287: are the larger part of the remainder. and then the generic-but-local layer
  (c) L344: l944, the site condition in the same table

  (c) L609: taking p02 finding 46 as current input (
  (c) L863: still uses the largest significant row's own figure. settled: the tier relation, which claims less
```

Hand triage of class (c): 7 fragments in class (c), each read at its line: L77, L287, L344, L554, L601, L609 and L863 are the piece's prose between two adjacent quotations. Pre-check: the 7 strings not found (blocks at L388, L553 twice, L700, L803, L916, L958) are proposed replacement wording written after the pass address it would replace (L388, L553, L700, L803), or readers' phrasings named in the contradictions and choices sections (L916, L958: "about nine to five"). No misquotation found.

**3 · American English sweep** (British forms; only "judgement" is kept). Raw output: none (0 hits).

**4 · Other locations' names and status words** (`grep` for 56 names and aliases, whole words; and for complete, completed, ready). Raw output: names none; status words none.

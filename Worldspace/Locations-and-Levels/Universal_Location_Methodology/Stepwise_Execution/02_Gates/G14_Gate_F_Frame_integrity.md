## ⛔ RULES FOR RUNNING THIS STEP — they are the same every time

1. **DO THIS STEP ONLY. STOP AT THE END.** Do not begin the next one. **Report, then wait.**
2. **PASTE RAW OUTPUT. NEVER SUMMARIZE IT.** *(`00_RUNBOOK.md` Step 7; `04` Gate 1.)* **A summary of a scan
   is not evidence that the scan ran.**
3. ⛔ **DO NOT SUPPLY A CRITERION THE INSTRUCTION DOES NOT STATE.** ***If you find yourself deciding what
   "should" exist, STOP AND ASK.*** **Every false finding on record came from this.**
4. ⛔ **DO NOT EDIT ANY FILE** unless this step's own text tells you to write something. **Finding a defect
   is not authorization to fix it.**
5. **If you cannot find something, that is the result.** **Log it. Do not route around it, do not substitute,
   do not proceed on a guess.**
6. **AMERICAN ENGLISH.** *(Global `CLAUDE.md`.)*

# THE INSTRUCTION

## Gate F — Frame integrity

**Does the pass stay inside its own declared frame?**

Four checks, each against a line of the Phase 0 declaration block:

1. **Type.** Did the pass answer the phases its type actually requires (`03` §0.1), or did it default to the
   Settlement set? **A Corridor written as a thin Settlement is the predictable failure**, and it shows up as a
   Phase 5 that is shorter than Phase 8.
2. **Band.** Is every claim scale-appropriate? **A Band 5 pass reading like a Band 3 pass has committed the
   scale error**, and a Band 1 pass that invents a general population has committed its inverse.
3. **Status.** Does a *declining* location read as declining, or as a healthy one with a sad note attached?
   Does a *ruined* one answer the Band 0 substitutions or the ordinary questions?
4. **Temporal frame.** Did post-frame facts leak in? **This has already happened in this project** — the city
   symbol assignments were first written partly from post-war facts when the subject was pre-war character, and
   had to be re-derived. **Sweep for the adjacent era's proper nouns specifically.**
